# Practice (C)

1. Lifo

Implement a LIFO data structure to store a geometric progression consisting of 15 elements, with a common ratio of x and an initial term n.
The program must support the following operations:
- Add a sequence of elements to the structure
- Remove a sequence of elements from the structure
- Display the current top sequence
The values of the variables x and n must not exceed 50 and 10.

2. Game field

Write a program where a 10x10 two-dimensional game field is created, and 12 'mines' are randomly placed such that they do not touch each other (there should be no mines in the neighboring cells of a mine). The game field should be represented as a two-dimensional array, with the type char and size 10x10. Empty cells (without mines) should be assigned the value 0, while cells containing mines should be marked with the symbol `*` .
